                            Program:<br><br>



                            I would like to thank you all for your participation in this past
                            year’s Sundown Salute Festival. Here is to another amazing year!
                            The following are IMPORTANT items that I need to make you aware of:<br><br>



                            1. If you are a vendor that needs electricity you will need to bring at least a 100’
                            extension
                            cord that is NOT SPLICED. Your cords must meet our City Inspectors Codes before you can open
                            for business.<br><br>



                            2. If you need to drive into the park to set-up you will need to enter at 5th and Jefferson
                            Street and stay on the sidewalk.<br><br>



                            3. If you will be selling soda/water or other refreshment you will need to supply the
                            product
                            and must pay an additional $250.00 fee to Sundown Salute. We will have ice for sale at the
                            event for vendors if needed. We will have two Sundown Salute trailers selling soda and water
                            in the park. This is the only soda and water that should be sold unless you have paid the
                            additional fee.<br><br>



                            4. Food vendors, ice will be for sale at the Information Booth. Ice will be available at the
                            Information Booth ONLY. You will be responsible for picking up your own ice and transporting
                            it to your area. If you have any questions or problems, please let us know.<br><br>



                            5. Please do not drive or park on the grass. The only vehicles that will be allowed to park
                            on
                            the grass are the food vender trailers, and that will be only in the food court area. Food
                            court vehicles can be driven into the food court area prior to opening each day, but they
                            must be moved immediately after unloading. We do not provide a place to park vehicles or
                            supply trailers. These vehicles cannot be parked on the streets around Heritage Park, as
                            this area is for Sundown Salute and Emergency Vehicles only. Thank you for your assistance
                            in this very important matter.<br><br>


                            6. Open times: July 3rd 5:00pm, July 4th, 11:00am (or after parade), July 5th 4:00pm, July
                            6th,
                            11:00am, July 7th 11:00am. Opening and Closing times are at your discretion. The Carnival
                            will be open each night until 11pm. Closing on this day is at your discretion.<br><br>

                            7. You must check-in at the Information Booth located adjacent to the water fountain prior
                            to setting up.<br><br>



                            Thank You for your continued support,<br><br>

                                Sundown Salute is gearing up for the annual 4th of July Sundown Salute parade. This
                                year’s theme is “Tribute to America.” This is to signify the role Geary County played in
                                the growing of the United States and all the USA has to offer. The parade will be on
                                July 4th, 2019 and starts at 10:00 am. Please note new regulations concerning entries to the parade.<br><br>
                                Whether you plan to be judged or not, all entries must be decorated according to this
                                theme or a patriotic theme!<br><br>
                                Prizes will be awarded to First, Second, and Third Places. Judging will be done in the
                                staging area so floats can be recognized as the winning floats during the parade. Your
                                cooperation in the staging area and parade route is expected and appreciated.
                                Your entry is free and we encourage you to be creative for this year’s parade. Remember,
